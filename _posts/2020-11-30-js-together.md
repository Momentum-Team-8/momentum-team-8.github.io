Today we will test our understanding and assumptions about javascript and do some live coding in class together. We'll also practice reading errors, debugging, and getting back on track when it feels like you're not making progress.

## In-class Project: Team Programming Exercise

We're going to live code together in class using a practice called _mob programming_. This is like pair programming, with more than two people but still only one computer. We produce code as a group and everyone participates in figuring out how to implement product features and writing the code.

## 🎯 Week-long Project: iTunes Search App

This project is due on Thursday of this week. You'll work on it incrementally each day this week.
