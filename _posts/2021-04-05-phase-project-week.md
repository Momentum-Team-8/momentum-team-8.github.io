## Today's topics

- Project check-in

## üéØ Project

The phase project is **due on Thursday**. Presentations will be on Thursday afternoon at 2.

(_We have a little flexibility with the schedule this week, so if we had to postpone to Friday, we could. But I would MUCH rather give you all Friday off!!_)

Go back to the project requirements and make sure you are able to do the things the project requires. Also check to make sure that you are not building features or functionality that you don't need!

By tomorrow you should have registration and login/logout working and data returning appropriately scoped to the logged-in user. CRUD functionality for questions and answers and user profile displays should be in place so that you can start working on the additional features (marking an answer as accepted, search, and starring questions).

All of the above should be working in production (Heroku for back-end and Netlify for front-end).

## Schedule this week: project check-ins

We won't have class at the regular times this week, and instead will use our time to finish our project. We will also meet at a scheduled time to see how things are going.

### Tuesday & Wednesday this week

At your appointed hour, please come to the Zoom classroom to meet with Amy and Jeanette. This is our scheduled time to make sure everyone is on track and things are going well. If we need more time, we can schedule it for later in the day.

#### Meeting times

Meet in the regular Zoom classroom at your assigned time.

**9:30-10**: Team Torpedo Shark & Team Rainbowfish

**10-10:30**: Team Swordtail & Team GloFish & Team Neon Tetra

### Thursday

No class or check-in meeting in the morning. Use the morning to prepare for presentations. Presentations at 2:00 pm in the classroom.

### Friday

Huddle and Career Services in the morning, but no project! Take the afternoon and weekend for some well-deserved R&R before Phase 4!!
