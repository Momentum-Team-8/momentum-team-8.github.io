## üóìÔ∏è Today's Topics

- Finishing up with code snippets and flashcards
- Talk briefly about technical presentations
- Q&A about Phase 3

## üéØ Django Duplex Project due Thursday @ 2:00pm

Thursday morning we will not have class. You should use that time to finish work on your project. Instructors will be available during regular class hours to help out.

## ü§© End-of-Phase Interview

For this phase we will ask you to meet with an instructor one-on-one to talk about your code instead of presenting to an audience. We'll ask you a few questions about Python, Django and the project you have been working on.

### Technical Questions

These are literally the questions we're going to ask you:

1. Walk us through what happens in Django when someone types a url like `www.djangoapp.com/card/2/edit` into a browser's address bar.
2. Open the django shell and select an object from your database, then get its related objects (we'll ask you different specifics here depending on what your models are).
3. Show me a template that uses conditional rendering and explain how that works.

**Interviews take place on Thursday during our normal class time, 2:00-3:30.** Please come to the classroom and we'll use breakout rooms for our separate meetings.
