## üóìÔ∏è Today's Topics

- Finishing up with code snippets and flashcards
- Talk briefly about technical presentations
- Q&A about Phase 3

## üéØ Django Duplex Project due Thursday @ 2:00pm

Thursday morning we will not have class. You should use that time to finish work on your project. Instructors will be available during regular class hours to help out.

## ü§© End-of-Phase Interview

For this phase we will ask you to meet with an instructor one-on-one to talk about your code instead of presenting to an audience. We'll ask you a few questions about Python, Django and the project you have been working on.

Interviews take place on Thursday during our normal class time, 2:00-3:30.
