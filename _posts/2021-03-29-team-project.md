## What's up this week 👀

1. Check in on last week's project
2. Tuesday: Open Source 101 conference
3. Start a cross-team project

## Tuesday: Open Source 101

We will not have class on Tuesday, but instead ask you to attend this live virtual-but-local conference. This conference is for professional technologists and is very beginner-friendly.

Check out the [conference information](https://opensource101.com/) including [the schedule](https://opensource101.com/schedules/2021/). You should examine this ahead of time and plan out what talks you will attend. Many occur at the same time so you will have to make some choices here.

[Register for a free ticket](https://allthingsopen.6connex.com/event/ATO/os101-2021/login) and make sure you complete the check-in process (you will likely get an email link to this once you've registered), which begins at 4:00 pm EDT on Monday, March 29.

We will attend this virtually but share the experience live over Slack in the `#open-source-101-2021` channel.

## 🎯 Collaborative Project

This week you will begin work on a project with both front- and back-end teammates. This project is due at the end of the Phase.

The front-end will build a React application that will make requests to the back-end application built with Django and Django REST Framework. There are no strict rules about who works on front end or back end, so your team can decide how best to use your resources.

Your team can choose between two projects. You should choose the one that seems most interesting to you. They will _both_ give you practice doing what you have been doing (building an API or building a React application based around CRUD functionality) but they present some different problems to solve. Choose the one that sounds more fun to you.

### Options

#### Social ECards

- [Project description](https://github.com/momentum-projects/group--social-cards/blob/main/README.md)
- [Social ECards assignment invitation](https://classroom.github.com/g/vAQ18u-Z) (one person on each team should accept first; see more info below)

#### QuestionBox

- [Project description](https://github.com/momentum-projects/group--questionbox/blob/main/README.md)
- [QuestionBox assignment invitation](https://classroom.github.com/g/wkVmXgl7) (one person on each team should accept first; see more info below)

Whichever one you choose, your whole team is building the same one. The backend will create its own repo and the front end will create its own repo, so for the same project you will have _two_ repos. **One person on each team should accept the assignment**, name the group with your Team Name, and then the other person can accept the assignment and choose the team that they belong to.

**When you start work in this repo, you should delete the README at the root** (You can save it somewhere else -- it's just a Markdown file). Then when you start your Django or React app, you should **install it at the root of the repo directory, not in a subdirectory** (you do this by specifying the current directory with a `.` instead of a project name). This will make deploying easier.

### The Teams

#### Back-end 🦈

- **Team Torpedo Shark**: Tristan & Grant
- **Team Swordtail**: Ben & Dawud

#### Front-end 🐠

- **Team Rainbowfish**: Tatiana & Albany -> Your back-end team is _Team Torpedo Shark_
- **Team Neon Tetra**: Tip & Cam -> Your back-end team is _Team Swordtail_
- **Team GloFish**: Laura & Arthur -> Your back-end team is _Team Swordtail_

One suggestion to consider: choose a team lead to act as a guide for your group. This person shouldn't be "in charge," but can serve as the decision-maker or tie-breaker if you're torn between different approaches to a problem. This can help speed you up.

We'll talk about the projects in class today. Remember to **read the README very carefully**. Your goal tonight should be to choose a project (make sure everyone, front and back, is on the sme page with this!), understand the project requirements, and begin to outline what you'll need to do and what you'll need to know in order to do this project. We haven't yet covered everything you'll need, so that will be our task this week and next!
