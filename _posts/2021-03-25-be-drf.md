## Today's Topics

Today we are going to dive into the Django REST Framework.

## üéØ Project

Add an API to Habit Tracker. (_note: There is no assignment repo or README for this._)

Add a new app to your existing Habit Tracker project and call it `api`. By the end of the week, your app should provide CRUD endpoints in JSON.

By Friday afternoon, you should be able to list, create, update, and delete habits.

By Monday, you should be able to complete all CRUD tasks through the API:

- list habits
- create a new habit
- view a habit
- update a habit
- delete a habit
- list records for a habit (on the habit detail API endpoint)
- create a record for a habit
- update a record for a habit
- delete a record from a habit

You should develop and test your endpoints using Insomnia. (If you want to change it up you can also play with another popular tool for building and testing APIs called [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)).

Your application should be deployed to Heroku.
