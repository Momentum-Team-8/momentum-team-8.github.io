## Veteran's Day -- no class

Use today to get some more JS practice in!

Review what we have seen so far in JS by going back over notes -- be sure to type out the code examples so that you can see the concepts illustrated in code for yourself. This will go a long way to establishing and deepening your understanding.

If you've finished both problem sets, consider doing today's optional project.

## Optional project: üëª Exercism: JavaScript Track

To get some more practice writing JavaScript, check out this awesome free online tool called [Exercism](https://exercism.io/).

You can sign up using your GitHub account. Choose [the JavaScript track](https://exercism.io/tracks/javascript). There are two ways to use Exercism, in Practice Mode or Mentor Mode. For now, just choose Practice Mode.

Work through the setup instructions to install Exercism on your computer with Homebrew. The following exercises in the JavaScript track are a great place to begin, but you're of course welcome to explore and find the exercises that you find interesting.

1. **TwoFer**
2. **Raindrops**
3. **Resistor Color**
4. **Hamming**
5. **High Scores**
6. **Word Count**

For each exercise, follow the instructions on Exercism to upload your solution. Once you do that you will be able to see the solutions other folks have posted for the same exercise.

I'm not requiring you to submit your solutions to this. In the past I've assigned this to be turned in, and I recorded a video to show folks how to get exercism set up and submitted in the following video. I'm just including this here in case anyone finds it useful.

## üîñ Resources

- [MDN JS Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [JS for Cats](http://jsforcats.com/) -- If you want a low-key walk through of basics, this is actually pretty helpful. It's older so you will see references to the `var` keyword instead of `let` or `const`.
