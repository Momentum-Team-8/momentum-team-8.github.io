## Today's topics

We are making time in our schedule for folks to vote, so we're not holding class in the afternoon or giving you any new assignment tonight.

- Orientation part 2
- Homework Review
- Questions about command line and git

### ✅ TODO today

1. If you haven't had a chance to contribute to our Team Charter document, please do so tonight.
   In this [Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f3HRylDSlw2fnkqLjC8_GjWIc0laXKnYVCMnDtAU6F4/edit?usp=sharing), record your answers to these questions:
   - What would make this team and classroom a good space for learning for you?
   - What would make this a safe and respectful place to work in?

   We'll review what everyone has written tomorrow, and once we are in agreement, this document will become our team charter.
2. Finish Git-It and read the [Really friendly command-line intro](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E4ALJrjclTYE4C6lwIV517-SOXiZ-Dqb/view?usp=sharing) and [Really friendly Git intro](https://drive.google.com/open?id=125rubyTQpBwmpi6I_UzUWfT1aXeHmy5n)
3. Watch [Your Brain's API](https://youtu.be/hY14Er6JX2s), a talk given at Pycon 2015 by Sasha Laundy, about giving and getting technical help. This is a super helpful video to watch!!
4. If you have not already completed the [Foundations Course](https://foundations.momentumlearn.com/), please do that! You'll get a review of the command line material and an intro to HTML and CSS, which we will begin formally tomorrow.
5. IF YOU STILL HAVE TIME: check out the [notes for HTML](https://github.com/momentum-team-6/notes/blob/main/html.md), which we will cover in class tomorrow.
