## üéØ Collaborative Project: QuestionBox

This week you will begin work on a project with both front- and back-end teammates. This project is due at the end of the Phase.

The front-end will build a React application that will make requests to the back-end application built with Django and Django REST Framework. There are no strict rules about who works on front end or back end, so your team can decide how best to use your resources.

- [Project description](https://github.com/momentum-projects/group--questionbox/blob/main/README.md)
- [QuestionBox assignment invitation](https://classroom.github.com/g/3UhN_XYn) (one person on each team should accept first; see more info below)

The backend will create its own repo and the front end will create its own repo, so for the same project you will have _two separate repos. **One person from each sub-team should accept the assignment**, name the group with your Team Name, and then the other person can accept the assignment and choose the team that they belong to.

**When you start work in this repo, you should delete the README at the root.** You can save it somewhere else -- it's just a Markdown file. Then when you start your Django or React app, you should **install your app at the root of the repo directory, not in a subdirectory** (you do this by specifying the current directory with a `.` instead of a project name). This will make deploying easier.

### Teams

Team Kraken = [Emily, Dee, Roan, Shaune]
Team Sasquatch = [Wendy, Quentin, Sara, Greg]
Team Mothman = [Wendy, Quentin, Logan, Brian]

One suggestion to consider: choose a team lead to act as a guide for your group. This person shouldn't be "in charge," but can serve as the decision-maker or tie-breaker if you're torn between different approaches to a problem. This can help speed you up.

We'll talk about the projects in class today. Remember to **read the README very carefully**. Your goal tonight should be to **plan out this project with your teammates**. Make sure everyone, front end and back end, is on the same page with the project requirements. Begin to outline what you'll need to do and what you'll need to know in order to do this project. You should write down the plans.

We haven't yet covered everything you'll need, so that will be our ongoing task this week and next!
