## üéØ Project

Complete [the official Django REST Framework tutorial](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/). You may find it easier going if you follow [the guide by Will Vincent](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/official-django-rest-framework-tutorial-beginners).

Will Vincent uses the exact same code and steps, but takes more time to explain what is going on and uses the django admin interface instead of the shell to create objects in the database. Will's tutorial stops short of the last step, [step 6](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/6-viewsets-and-routers/), in the official tutorial. But if you finish step 5 and want to keep going, you can [continue with the official tutorial](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/6-viewsets-and-routers/).

You should complete the tutorial by tomorrow afternoon.

Some tips about the DRF Tutorial to keep in mind:

- _Do not copy & paste the code_. You'll get a lot more out of it if you type it out yourself.
- Don't use the Momentum Django Project Template. The custom user model in that template conflicts with the tutorial.
