## 🎯 Project: Continue Habit Tracker

You should aim for Habit Tracker to be done on Monday. Implement as much as you can, and we will check in with how far everyone has gotten. There are examples for a lot of what you need to do in the Django Recipes codebase but you will have to adapt them to your Habit Tracker use cases.

This section is material to prep for our next topic, building APIs.

- [RESTful APIs](https://restful-api-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) -- read up through the "Standard Methods" subsection of the section on "Methods". You can read more if you want to but it gets pretty deep.

You do not need to write SQL because the Django ORM does it for you, and it does it well. But most developers can drop into SQL if they need to work with the database directly.
