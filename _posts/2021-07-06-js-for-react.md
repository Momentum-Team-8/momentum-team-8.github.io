## ⚛️ Welcome back to Front-End Development!

Congratulations on your desicion to continue your journey at Momentum as a front-end developer! During Phase 3 we are going to take a dive into a popular JavaScript framework called React, which is used to build single-page applications. Before we jump into the deep waters of React development, let's dip our toes into some JavaScript ES6 and reaquaint ourselves with JS syntax and logic.
