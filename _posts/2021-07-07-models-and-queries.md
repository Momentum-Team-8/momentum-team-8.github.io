- The woes of deployment & what to do about them
- Django managers, lookups, and querysets
- Using the Django shell to make queries

## 🎯 Project: Continue Building Habit Tracker

Today you should finalize your models and begin building out the urls, views, and templates you will need. Before you write the code, plan for what you will need.

There are examples for a lot of what you need to do in the Django Recipes codebase but you will have to adapt them to your Habit Tracker use cases.

## 🌟 EXTRA/TMI

- [SQL Basics: Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/sql/) -> this is a helpful reference for SQL syntax when you run into it. You do not need to write SQL for Django because the Django ORM does it for you, and it does it well. The Django docs often illustrate queries made by the ORM using SQL syntax, however, and you will find it helpful in your job to know the basics.
