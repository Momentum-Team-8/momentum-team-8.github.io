## This week: Review and Catch Up ðŸ˜…

For this short week, catch up on any unfinished assignments or concepts that you need to spend more time with. We'll spend time in class getting past blockers in the notes app assignment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Optional Projects

These are **100% optional**. I'm making these available if you want something new to work on during the holiday. Choose one, or both -- or none. There is **no expectation** that you work over the holiday week! Please take time to rest and relax even if you do decide to write some code.

### Memory Game

Build a classic memory-style game for the browser. Choose this one if you want more practice with events and logic in JavaScript.

### GitHub Profile

Build a simple page using data from the GitHub API. Choose this one if you want more practice with getting data from APIs and showing that data on the page by interacting with the DOM.sl`
