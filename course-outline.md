# Course Outline

For the entire 16 weeks, we are in session each day between 9:30 am - 5:30 pm, with a 1-hour break expected for lunch. You are expected to be online and available during these hours.

We will not have class during the Thanksgiving holidays (Weds Nov 25-Friday Nov 27).

## Class & Assignments

### Daily schedule

Class during Phases 1-2 meets twice a day Monday-Thursday, from 9:30 am to 11:30 am and again from 2:00 pm to 3:30 pm. In the interim, please take a lunch break and get started on the assignment for that day.

Lab time continues after class from 3:30 pm to 5:30 pm Monday-Thursday and 9:30 am - 5:30 pm on Friday. Friday afternoons are reserved as optional class meeting time, if indicated by your instructor.

Fridays also often include mandatory group meetings for the Campus Huddle/Speaker Series and Career Services Modules. You will receive calendar invitations for these meetings, which are usually scheduled in the 9:30-11:30 am range.

### Daily Assignments

Monday-Wednesday, you'll be given an assignment that you'll work on during lab time that day. Although our structured day officially ends at 5:30 pm, you will likely find that you need more time that evening to complete the assignment.

Daily assignments are due before the start of class the following morning. Homework submission is through GitHub.

Each day, class will begin with a review of homework from the day before. Come prepared to show your code and ask questions.

### Weekend Assignments

On Thursdays, you'll be given an assignment that will ask you to bring together everything you've learned that week. This assignment is expected to be more challeging and take longer to complete than your daily assignments. You can expect to work on this through the weekend.

Weekend assignments are due on Monday morning before the start of class.

## Office hours and one-on-one instruction

Your instructor and/or other members of the instructional team will be available during lab times.

The instructional team is:

- Amy Gori

Instructors are also available to meet with you on Zoom during lab times, individually, in groups, or in the co-working Zoom.

### Phase 3: Advanced Front-end or Advanced Back-end

Each student chooses to learn more deeply in either front-end or back-end topics in this phase. You'll be asked to do more independent work alongside regular classroom meetings with your instructor as you learn to build more complex projects.

### Phase 4: Agile Development

Students work on small teams to design and build a complete, real-world software product using the practices of professional software developers. You'll be working independently under the close supervision of your instructor to meet tight deadlines. To graduate, you will present your project to members of the local tech community.
